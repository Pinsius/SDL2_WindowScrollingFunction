# SDL2_WindowScrollingFunction
File containing a function that can be used for rendering scrollable elements - so they are cropped correctly

This function is excepting following things:
1. You are using SDL2 to render graphics - it means you are using SDL_Renderer 
2. You are using SDL_Textures as a source for images

For better "graphical" understanding of the function parameters and their meaning, i included a png picture.
